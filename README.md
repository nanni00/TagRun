# TagRun

A simple program which may help on file managing.
You can create a tag and append an absolute file/directory path to it. It includes context menu options to better handle the operations.

Run the scripts as administrator, otherwise it will be impossible create context menu options and directories in C:/Program Files in Windows.
You can download executable files from [here](https://github.com/Giovanni-M00/TagRun/raw/master/app_installer/dist/installer.exe)
